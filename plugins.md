|PythonEvaluator                |PythonEvaluator                |Executes user-provided python code that transforms one record into zero or more records. Each input record is converted into a dictionary which can be directly accessed in python. The transform expects to receive a dictionary as input, which it can process and emit zero or more transformed dictionaries, or emit an error dictionary using the provided emitter object.|
|JavaScript                     |JavaScript                     |Executes user-provided JavaScript that transforms one record into zero or more records. Input records are converted into JSON objects which can be directly accessed in JavaScript. The transform expects to receive a JSON object as input, which it can process and emit zero or more records or emit error using the provided emitter object.                               |
|Projection                     |Projection                     |The Projection transform lets you drop, keep, rename, and cast fields to a different type.

|XMLMultiParser                 |XMLMultiParser                 |The XML Multi Parser Transform uses XPath to extract fields from an XML document. It will generate records from the children of the element specified by the XPath. If there is some error parsing the document or building the record, the problematic input record will be dropped.                                                                                          |
|ValueMapper                    |ValueMapper                    |Value Mapper is a transform plugin that maps string values of a field in the input record to a mapping value using a mapping dataset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|XMLToJSON                      |XMLToJSON                      |Accepts a field that contains a properly-formatted XML string and  outputs a properly-formatted JSON string version of the data. This is  meant to be used with the Javascript transform for the parsing of  complex XML documents into parts. Once the XML is a JSON string, you  can convert it into a Javascript object using:                                              |

|Normalize                      |Normalize                      |Normalize is a transform plugin that breaks one source row into multiple target rows. Attributes stored in the columns of a table or a file may need to be broken into multiple records: for example, one record per column attribute. In general, the plugin allows the conversion of columns to rows.                                                                        |

|AddField                       |AddField                       |Adds a new field to each record. The field value can either be a new UUID, or it can be set directly through configuration. This transform is used when you want to add a unique id field to each record, or when you want to tag each record with some constant value. For example, you may want to add the logical start time as a field to each record.                     |
|MultiFieldAdder                |MultiFieldAdder                |Multi Field Adder Transform allows you to add one or more fields to the output. Each field specified has a name and the value.

|DynamicMultiFileset             |DynamicMultiFileset                |This plugin is normally used in conjunction with the MultiTableDatabase batch source to write records from multiple databases into multiple filesets in text format. Each fileset it writes to will contain a single 'ingesttime' partition, which will contain the logical start time of the pipeline run. The plugin expects that the filsets it needs to write to will be set as pipeline arguments, where the key is 'multisink.[fileset]' and the value is the fileset schema. Normally, you rely on the MultiTableDatabase source to set those pipeline arguments, but they can also be manually set or set by an Action plugin in your pipeline. The sink will expect each record to contain a special split field that will be used to determine which records are written to each fileset. For example, suppose the the split field is 'tablename'. A record whose 'tablename' field is set to 'activity' will be written to the 'activity' fileset.|

|MultiTableDatabase  |Multiple Database Tables      |Reads from multiple tables within a database using JDBC. Often used in conjunction with the DynamicMultiFileset sink to perform dumps from multiple tables to HDFS files in a single pipeline. The source will output a record for each row in the tables it reads, with each record containing an additional field that holds the name of the table the record came from. In addition, for each table that will be read, this plugin will set pipeline arguments where the key is 'multisink.[tablename]' and the value is the schema of the table. This is to make it work with the DynamicMultiFileset.|

|MLPredictor                 |MLPredictor                 |Uses a model trained by the ModelTrainer plugin to add a prediction field to incoming records. The same features used to train the model must be present in each input record, but input records can also contain additional non-feature fields. If the trained model uses categorical features, and if the record being predicted contains new categories, that record will be dropped. For example, suppose categorical feature 'city' was used to train a model that predicts housing prices. If an incoming record has 'New York' as the city, but 'New York' was not in the training set, that record will be dropped.|
